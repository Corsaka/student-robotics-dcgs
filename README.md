# Hello people!

**Firstly:**

DO NOT COMMIT TO MASTER.

**Secondly:**

DO NOT COMMIT TO MASTER.

**Thirdly:**

The master branch is for downloading. Request to add your command from the commands branch into it.

The commands branch is for putting a file of a single command that you've made. You can then request it be merged into master.

The templates branch is a bunch of examples of how the scripts work. They should be well commented; if they're not, add comments.

**How to Put Code onto Robot:**

To put code into the robot, you will need to commit to the master branch. 
Paste code into the *robot.py* file which is inside the *user* folder.
**DO NOT CHANGE ANY OTHER FILE.**
Then these things need to happen:

1. Unzip the file.
2. Open the unzipped folder.
3. Zip everything in this folder into a folder called *robot.zip*.
4. Put that zip onto the robot's USB.


**That is all.**
