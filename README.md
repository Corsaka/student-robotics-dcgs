# Hello people!

**Firstly:**

DO NOT COMMIT TO MASTER.

**Secondly:**

DO NOT COMMIT TO MASTER.

**Thirdly:**

The master branch is for downloading. Request to add your command from the commands branch into it.

The commands branch is for putting a file of a single command that you've made. You can then request it be merged into master.

The templates branch is a bunch of examples of how the scripts work. They should be well commented; if they're not, add comments.

**That is all.**
