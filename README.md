**Firstly:**

DO NOT COMMIT TO MASTER.

**Secondly:**

DO NOT COMMIT TO MASTER.

**Thirdly:**

The master branch is for downloading. If you want to make changes to the robot.py file, edit it in the master branch but select "Make a new branch for this commit".

The commands branch is for putting a file of a single command that you've made. You can then request it be merged into master.

The templates branch is a bunch of examples of how the scripts work. They should be well commented; if they're not, add comments.

**Finally...**

If you're still confused about any of the code, see the official Documentation located here:

**That is all.**
